### Why a web developer and not another job ?

I was quickly drawn to web development and I'm afraid of emptiness so... ðŸ’¨ (naturally) I headed for the web a mixture of **programming** and
of **design** two elements that interest me **greatly.**

### Etude HESTIM, 1337 ?
```javascript
const Soulaimane = new Object();
function God() {
  if(Soulaimane.diplomes > 0){
    return console.log("I'm you'r graduate men !");
  }
 return console.log("Sorry, i can do nothing for you.");
}
```

*Sorry, i can do nothing for you.*

**Well, ok.. okay ðŸ˜•, I admit it, I learned everything on my own in my corner, so what?**
  - [x] Nobody forces me to do it and yet I do it .
  - [x] Learning every day has become a habit .
  - [x] Having to solve problems alone is an obligation .
  - [x] Know how to do research .
  - [ ] Sleeping in class because the teacher is on autopilot *(Easy criticism, but true)* .
  ```
  Error: Too many re-renders. God limits number of
  renders to prevent an infinite loop of stupidity.
  ```

&nbsp;

## And what did you do then ?

**I developed projects entirely from the development of the model to the deployment and discovered a multitude of technologies.**<br/>

In addition, as I learned by passion with **my time** and **my savings** ðŸ’³, I know in advance that for all professional projects
I'm **over-motivated** at the idea of **creating** someone's project and **helping them**.<br/>
~~Every day~~, I strengthen my knowledge to always go further and advance towards my goals.
```js
function GodDetectBullshit(isBullshit) {
  if(isBullshit){
    return console.log("5.5 jours sur 7");
  }
 return console.log(isBullshit);
}
 ```


### It's finish ? I can leave ?

Yes
> Non ðŸ˜­


I also have a **Youtube** channel where I share my knowledge on specific issues in order to best help as many people as possible and above all
I try to ensure that for as many people as possible this does not end up with an error on their screens.<br/>
*(That vaguely reminds me of a feeling)*

**Most of my projects are detailed on my github profile with precise and illustrated explanations.**<br/>
